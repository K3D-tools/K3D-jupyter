# How to

## Add loader strategy for new object type

1. Define a loader strategy function in `app/providers/<PROVIDER>/objects/<TYPE>.js`

   ### Parameters

   **config**  
   An instance of `K3D.Config` containing an object configuration passed to loader

   ### Return value

   A `Promise` which should eventually resolve with the value of object ready to render

2. Define a interaction function in `app/providers/<PROVIDER>/interactions/<TYPE>.js`

   > **Note**  
   This step is required for interactive objects only

   ### Parameters

   **arg1, arg2, ...**  
   An arbitrary list of arguments

   ### Return value

   An object with `onHover(intersect, viewMode)` and `onClick(intersect, viewMode)` methods.

   > **Note**  
   This function should be explicitly called by loader strategy function and it's return value
   should be assigned to result object's `interactions` property.

## Change 3D library (provider) used

After reimplementing what's required in a separate folder inside `app/providers/<PROVIDER>` you will
be able to use new provider.
Additional changes in `app/index.html` might be required to make the "build" and "serve" tasks
working.
