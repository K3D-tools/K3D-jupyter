K3D-jupyter - documentation
===========================



K3D-jupyter is a Jupyter notebook 3D visualization package.

The primary aim of K3D is to be an easy tool for 3D visualization. We
designed it with native interoperation with existing powerful
libraries such as VTK. However, it is not strictly dependent on them.
K3D plots are :code:`ipywidgets` assuring a perfect interaction of a browser
side widget with Python kernel by a proven and standardized protocol.
